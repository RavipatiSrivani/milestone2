    <h3><u>What is cryptocurrency?</u></h3>A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment
    created using <b>encryption algorithms.</b> The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function
    both as a currency and as a <b>virtual accounting system.</b> To use cryptocurrencies, you need a cryptocurrency
    wallet. These wallets can be software that is a <b>cloud-based service</b> or is stored on your computer or on your
    mobile device. The wallets are the tool through which you store your encryption keys that confirm your identity and
    link to your cryptocurrency.

    <h3><u>What are the risks to using cryptocurrency?</u></h3> Cryptocurrencies are still relatively new, and the market for
    these digital currencies is very volatile. Since cryptocurrencies don't need banks or any other third party to
    regulate them; they tend to be uninsured and are hard to convert into a form of tangible currency (such as US
    dollars or euros.) In addition, since cryptocurrencies are technology-based intangible assets, they can be
    <b>hacked</b> like any other intangible technology asset. Finally, since you store your cryptocurrencies in a
    digital wallet, if you lose your wallet (or access to it or to wallet backups), you have lost your entire
    cryptocurrency investment.</p>

    <h3><u>Follow these tips to protect your cryptocurrencies:</u></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Look before you leap!</b> Before investing in a cryptocurrency, be sure you understand how it works,
            where it can be used, and how to exchange it.</li>

        <li><b>Use a trustworthy wallet.</b> It is going to take some research on your part to choose the right wallet
            for your needs.</li>

        <li><b>Have a backup strategy.</b>Think about what happens if your computer or mobile device is lost. Without a
            backup strategy, you will have no way of getting your cryptocurrency back, and you could lose your
            investment.</li>
    </ul>
